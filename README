Description:
  You can use This script to help you make a menu which only appears when  you are editing buffers with a certain filetype. You can use this script  to make menus in your ftplugin scripts.

  The menu is automatically made once you enter a buffer whose  filetype is specified. And if you switch to another buffer with a  different filetype, the revious menu is automatically deleted.

Usage:
  In your ftplugin scripts, follow these steps:
  1. write a function which creates a menu. The function should not
     start with s: or <SID>.
  2. call BW_RegisterFTMenu function which is the only function provided by this script
  That's all.

  Here is an example. I want to create a menu only for python files,  so I create a function in my ftplugin/python.vim:

  function MakeFTMenu_python
    amenu 8000.11 Python.check :echo 'check python script'
    amenu 8000.12 Python.run :echo 'run python script'
  endfunction

  and then, add this statement to the same .vim file:

  call BW_RegisterFTMenu('python','Python','MakeFTMenu_python')

  Note: the second parameter MUST be the same with the name of the menu
        which you created in MakeFTMenu_python function.
